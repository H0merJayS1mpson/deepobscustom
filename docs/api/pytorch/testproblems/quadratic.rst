Quadratic Test Problems
=======================

DeepOBS includes a stochastic quadratic problem with an eigenspectrum similar to
what has been reported for neural networks.

Other stochastic quadratic problems (of different dimensionality or with a
different Hessian structure) can be created easily using the ``net_quadratic_deep``
class.
